![OpenStop](fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/featureGraphic.png)

The goal of this app is to collect accessibility data for public transport stops in [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) so that everyone can benefit from it.
Due to the huge amount of public transport stops out there we want to encourage all citizen (experienced OSM users and newcomers) to help gathering this data. That's why we are developing this app that allows collecting the data in an easy, accessible and safe manner by asking simple questions. For deeper insight read  the [working principle](/docs/WORKING_PRINCIPLE.md) of the app.

The data shall be the foundation for better routing especially for impaired people and lead to a renovation of non accessible stops, as well as many other things we ourselves can't even imagine right now.

Thanks and happy mapping!
